# To-Do List App: Because Procrastination is a Full-Time Job!

Welcome to the **To-Do List App**, where we take your tasks and organize them like a well-trained puppy! This handy little application uses a **Binary Search Tree** (BST) to keep your tasks in line, ensuring that nothing gets lost in the chaos of your daily life. 

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Because ignoring them won't make them disappear!
- **Display Tasks**: See what you've got on your plate (or your desk, or your floorâ€¦).
- **Modify Tasks**: Change descriptions and due dates faster than you can say "I'll do it tomorrow."
- **Delete Tasks**: Out with the old, in with theâ€¦ well, maybe just out!
- **Complete Tasks**: Check them off like a boss!

## How It Works
1. **Task Structure**: Each task is a little package of joy that contains an ID, description, due date, and a completion status. Think of it as a digital sticky note that wonâ€™t fall off your fridge!
   
2. **Binary Search Tree**: Your tasks are stored in a BSTâ€”because who doesnâ€™t love a good tree? It keeps everything organized so you can find tasks faster than you can find your phone when it's on silent.

3. **User Input**: The app prompts you for task details. Just type it in and let the magic happen! (We promise not to judge your procrastination habits.)
