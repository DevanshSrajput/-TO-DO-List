## Overview
Welcome to the **TO-DO List** application, where procrastination meets productivity! Built in C with Binary Search Trees (BST) and Linked Lists, this command-line tool helps you tackle tasks without judgment—because we all know that “organize sock drawer” is just as important as “save the world.” So fire up the terminal, grab a snack, and let’s turn those tasks into yesterday’s news!
Thank you for the clarification! Here’s an updated README file that reflects the use of data structures like Binary Search Trees (BST) and Linked Lists in C.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Insert new tasks into the list.
- **View Tasks**: Display all tasks in a sorted order.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks easily.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list as needed.
- **Persistent Storage**: Store tasks using linked lists for dynamic memory management.

## Data Structures Used
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of tasks.
- **Linked List**: Utilized for managing task nodes dynamically.

## Technologies Used
- C Programming Language

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevanshSrajput/-TO-DO-List.git
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch the application in your terminal.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to add, view, edit, or delete tasks.
3. The tasks will be displayed in a sorted manner thanks to the BST implementation.
